# SpreadLabs
Social Media Suite

Welcome, this is a project I coded meanwhile I was learning Python/Django a couple of years ago, after some considerations I choose to release as AGPL software, in that way, can help others too.

This is how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmCvYQHhPQA

At that time I don't put so much attention on the good tecniques of frontend, I'm going to be pushing fixes on my free time, if you wanna help in any way, please be free.

### Todo List:
* Export requirements.txt
* Complete migration to Foundation
* Design and code the Login page
* Update chart plugins
* Switch to SASS
* Improve the JS code
* Get the JS compresor working

Any feedback is apreciated, my mail is me@chrissmejia.com

Thanks for your time.
